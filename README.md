# Cows-and-Bulls-Godot
To play, download the repo, load the project into Godot, and compile the game to get an EXE or just play straight from the Editor. This repo contains a digital version of the classic oral game Cows and Bulls. I wrote this in about an hour and a half (most of which was sent trying to undersand the substr function in godot) on a whim after playing with family. I may update this to look decent and release a web version, I may try my hand at making this a mobie game, I may try to release this for Amazon Alexa or Google Home, and I may create an AI that plays optimally or near optimally. Or I may abandon it and move on to a bigger and grander project.
